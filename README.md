# bloodbankphp
Blood Bank PHP is a web-based application that aims to streamline the process of managing blood donors and facilitating blood search requests. This project provides a user-friendly interface for both donors and blood seekers to efficiently interact with the system, making it easier to coordinate blood donation efforts and save lives.

Key Features
Donor Registration: Users can register as blood donors by providing their personal information, contact details, blood group, and relevant medical history.

Blood Search: Blood seekers can search for available blood donors based on blood type requirements and availability. The system generates a list of potential donors matching the search criteria, displaying their contact information and availability.

Donor List: The system maintains a comprehensive list of registered blood donors, providing contact information and blood group details. This helps facilitate quick access to potential donors in times of need.

User Management: Administrators have access to user management features, allowing them to validate registrations, handle updates or deletions, and ensure the smooth functioning of the system.
